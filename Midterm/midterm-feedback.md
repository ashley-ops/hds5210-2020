# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
48 / 50

This is well done and I like the approach you took for generalizing how you do lookups to get back the scores.  There's no on else in the class who took an approach quite like this.


## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.  This structure works well.

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - This function works well and covers all of the range-based scenarios.  You didn't write independent functions for the more complex components, though (FiO2, Creatinine) (-1)

## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice work.  I like how all of this came together the way you did it.  The only downside is the two scenarios where you built logic into this function rather than into the JSON structure itself.  (-1)


## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - Nice work comparing things.  I mentioned in a later announcement that there was an error in the original submission.  You got things put together fine.
